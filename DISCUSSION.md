# Discussion

Hi Solace! Thanks for sending over this assignment. I enjoyed working on it.

Some items I would tackle next if the project was a going concern:

- Solidify theming and styling conventions and values. Many of my CSS choices use one-off values for things like font sizes and spacings. Having a clear set of commonly used variables (ie fonts, spacings, rem vs px, etc) would increase developer velocity and reduce errors

- A well-designed solution for mobile. Wide tables on smaller screen sizes is always a tricky ask. Some possible solutions include scrollable overflow, cards, or accordion-style dropdowns. I would consult with our design experts to find consensus

Please let me know if you have any questions!
